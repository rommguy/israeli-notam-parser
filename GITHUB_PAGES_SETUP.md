# GitHub Pages Deployment Setup

Follow these steps to deploy your NOTAM Viewer web application to GitHub Pages:

## 1. Enable GitHub Pages in Repository Settings

1. Go to your GitHub repository: `https://github.com/rommguy/israeli-notam-parser`
2. Click on **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section in the left sidebar
4. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**
5. Save the settings

## 2. Commit and Push the New Files

The following files have been created/modified for GitHub Pages deployment:

- `.github/workflows/deploy-web.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow for deployment
- `web/vite.config.ts` - Updated with correct base path for GitHub Pages
- `GITHUB_PAGES_SETUP.md` - This instruction file

Commit and push these changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add GitHub Pages deployment workflow for web application"
git push origin main
```

## 3. Verify Deployment

1. After pushing, go to the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository
2. You should see a "Deploy Web Application to GitHub Pages" workflow running
3. Wait for it to complete (usually takes 2-3 minutes)
4. Once successful, your web application will be available at:
   
   **https://rommguy.github.io/israeli-notam-parser/**

## 4. Automatic Updates

The web application will automatically redeploy when:
- You push changes to the `web/` directory
- New NOTAM data is added to `daily-notams/` directory (via your existing daily workflow)
- You manually trigger the workflow from the Actions tab

## 5. Custom Domain (Optional)

If you want to use a custom domain:
1. Add a `CNAME` file to the `web/public/` directory with your domain name
2. Configure your DNS settings to point to `rommguy.github.io`
3. Update the base path in `web/vite.config.ts` accordingly

## Troubleshooting

### If the deployment fails:
1. Check the Actions tab for error messages
2. Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings
3. Verify that the workflow has the correct permissions

### If the app loads but data doesn't work:
1. Check that JSON files are being copied correctly in the build logs
2. Verify that the date files exist in the `daily-notams/` directory
3. Check browser console for any 404 errors

### If styling looks broken:
1. Verify the base path is correctly set in `vite.config.ts`
2. Check that the repository name matches the base path

## Features Available on GitHub Pages

Your deployed web application will include:
- ✅ Interactive NOTAM viewer with Material-UI design
- ✅ Date selection (today/tomorrow)
- ✅ ICAO code filtering
- ✅ Read/unread tracking (stored in browser localStorage)
- ✅ Statistics dashboard
- ✅ Google Maps integration for coordinates
- ✅ Mobile-responsive design
- ✅ Automatic updates when new NOTAM data is available

The application will work entirely in the browser using the static JSON files generated by your existing GitHub Actions workflow.
