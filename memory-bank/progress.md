- **Date Selection**: 100% - Today/tomorrow date filtering
- **ICAO Filtering**: 100% - Multi-select airport/FIR filtering
- **Read/Unread Tracking**: 100% - Persistent localStorage state management
- **Statistics Dashboard**: 100% - Real-time stats and completion tracking
- **Responsive Design**: 100% - Mobile-friendly Material-UI interface

## What's In Progress

- **Storage Implementation**: 0% - Planning phase for JSON file persistence
- **Documentation Updates**: 90% - Memory bank updated, code documentation needed
- **CLI Feature Restoration**: 0% - Planning phase for advanced filtering and export functionality

## What's Left To Build

### CLI Application Priority

- **Storage Persistence**: HIGH - JSON file storage for fetched NOTAMs
- **Advanced Filtering**: HIGH - Date, ICAO, and type filtering functionality
- **JSON Export**: HIGH - Export functionality with automatic file management
- **Enhanced CLI Interface**: MEDIUM - Comprehensive command-line options and help system
- **Performance Optimization**: MEDIUM - Caching and browser automation optimization

### General Improvements

- **Testing Suite**: HIGH - Browser automation testing, unit tests, integration tests
- **Code Documentation**: MEDIUM - JSDoc comments and updated inline documentation
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: MEDIUM - Browser automation error recovery and retry mechanisms
- **Monitoring and Logging**: LOW - Enhanced logging and monitoring capabilities

## Known Issues

- **Feature Regression**: HIGH - Advanced filtering and export functionality removed during refactoring
- **No Storage Persistence**: HIGH - NOTAMs are only logged to console, not saved
- **Hardcoded Dependencies**: MEDIUM - NOTAM ID comparison uses hardcoded array instead of dynamic storage
- **Limited Browser Automation Testing**: MEDIUM - No automated testing for Playwright workflows
- **Performance Overhead**: MEDIUM - Browser automation is slower than static scraping
- **Documentation Gap**: LOW - Code documentation needs updating for new architecture

## Milestones

- **v1.0.0 Initial Release**: COMPLETED - Original CLI with static scraping
- **Browser Automation Refactoring**: IN_PROGRESS - Playwright integration and dynamic content handling
- **Storage Implementation Phase**: PENDING - Add JSON file persistence
- **Feature Restoration Phase**: PENDING - Re-implement filtering and export functionality
- **Testing Phase**: PENDING - Implement comprehensive testing suite
- **Enhancement Phase**: PENDING - Performance optimization and additional features
