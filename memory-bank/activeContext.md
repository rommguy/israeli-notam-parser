# Active Context: NOTAM Parser for Israeli Aviation Authority

_Version: 1.2_
_Created: 2025-01-27_
_Last Updated: 2025-09-13_
_Current RIPER Mode: RESEARCH_

## Current Focus

Major refactoring completed to replace static scraping with Playwright browser automation. The system now handles dynamic content expansion and extracts comprehensive NOTAM data. Current functionality fetches and logs NOTAMs to console, with storage persistence planned as the next major feature.

## Recent Changes

- **2025-09-13**: Updated memory bank files to reflect current Playwright-based architecture
- **2025-09-13**: Removed outdated references to parser.ts and static scraping approach
- **2025-09-13**: Updated documentation to reflect browser automation and dynamic content handling
- **Recent**: Major refactoring to replace Cheerio/Axios with Playwright browser automation
- **Recent**: Removed parser.ts file and consolidated parsing logic into scraper.ts
- **Recent**: Implemented dynamic NOTAM expansion with click automation and content waiting
- **Recent**: Added incremental fetching using hardcoded NOTAM ID comparison
- **Recent**: Simplified CLI to basic functionality (advanced filtering temporarily removed)
- **Recent**: Added support for both headless and visible browser modes for debugging
- 2025-01-27 - Created memory-bank directory structure and completed START phase
- 2025-01-27 - Implemented complete React web application with Material-UI (web/ folder unchanged)

## Active Decisions

- **BROWSER AUTOMATION APPROACH**: Playwright chosen over static scraping for dynamic content handling
- **INCREMENTAL PROCESSING**: Hardcoded NOTAM ID comparison to avoid duplicate processing
- **FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING ENFORCED**: No custom classes allowed in this project - all business logic uses pure functions
- **CONSOLE OUTPUT CURRENT**: Storage persistence planned but not yet implemented
- **SIMPLIFIED CLI**: Advanced filtering and export functionality temporarily removed during refactoring
- **DUAL BROWSER MODES**: Support both headless and visible browser modes for debugging
- **Web Application Architecture**: COMPLETED - React with Material-UI, TypeScript, and Vite (unchanged)
- **Data Strategy**: CLI and web app are separate - web app uses static JSON files, CLI uses live browser automation

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Storage Persistence**: Add functionality to save fetched NOTAMs to local files (JSON format)
2. **Re-implement Advanced Filtering**: Add back date, ICAO, and type filtering functionality
3. **Add Export Functionality**: Restore JSON export capabilities with automatic file management
4. **Enhance CLI Interface**: Restore comprehensive command-line options and help system
5. **Optimize Incremental Updates**: Replace hardcoded NOTAM IDs with dynamic storage-based comparison
6. **Add Error Recovery**: Improve browser automation error handling and retry mechanisms
7. **Performance Optimization**: Add caching and optimize browser automation for repeated runs

## Current Challenges

- **Feature Regression**: Advanced filtering and export functionality was removed during refactoring and needs re-implementation
- **Storage Implementation**: No persistence layer currently exists - NOTAMs are only logged to console
- **Hardcoded Dependencies**: NOTAM ID comparison uses hardcoded array instead of dynamic storage
- **Browser Automation Complexity**: Managing browser lifecycle and handling dynamic content failures
- **Performance Overhead**: Browser automation is slower and more resource-intensive than static scraping
- **Testing Coverage**: Limited automated testing for browser automation workflows
- **Documentation Gap**: Code documentation needs updating for new Playwright-based architecture

## Implementation Progress

### Browser Automation Refactoring (Current Focus)

- [✓] Replaced Cheerio/Axios static scraping with Playwright browser automation
- [✓] Implemented dynamic NOTAM content expansion with click automation
- [✓] Added comprehensive NOTAM data extraction (A/B/C sections, Q coordinates, D descriptions)
- [✓] Implemented incremental fetching using NOTAM ID comparison
- [✓] Added support for both headless and visible browser modes
- [✓] Updated all memory bank documentation to reflect new architecture
- [ ] **IN PROGRESS**: Storage persistence implementation
- [ ] **PLANNED**: Advanced filtering functionality restoration
- [ ] **PLANNED**: JSON export functionality restoration
- [ ] **PLANNED**: Enhanced CLI interface restoration

### Web Application (Completed)

- [✓] Complete React application with Material-UI and TypeScript
- [✓] All core components and data layer implemented
- [✓] localStorage integration for read/unread state persistence
- [✓] Responsive design with aviation-themed UI
- [✓] Successfully built and tested application

## Project Status Summary

The NOTAM Parser consists of two main components:

### CLI Application (Currently Refactoring)

- ✅ Browser automation with Playwright for dynamic content handling
- ✅ Comprehensive NOTAM data extraction with expansion automation
- ✅ Incremental fetching to avoid duplicate processing
- ✅ Google Maps integration for coordinate data
- ✅ Support for both headless and visible browser modes
- ⏳ Storage persistence (in development)
- ❌ Advanced filtering functionality (temporarily removed)
- ❌ JSON export functionality (temporarily removed)
- ❌ Comprehensive CLI options (temporarily simplified)

### Web Application (Feature Complete)

- ✅ Complete React application with Material-UI
- ✅ Date selection and ICAO filtering
- ✅ Read/unread tracking with localStorage
- ✅ Statistics dashboard and responsive design
- ✅ Static JSON data consumption

## Potential Enhancement Areas

### CLI Application Priority

- **Storage Implementation**: Add JSON file persistence for fetched NOTAMs (HIGH)
- **Feature Restoration**: Re-implement filtering and export functionality (HIGH)
- **CLI Enhancement**: Restore comprehensive command-line options (MEDIUM)
- **Performance Optimization**: Add caching and browser automation optimization (MEDIUM)
- **Error Recovery**: Enhance browser automation error handling (MEDIUM)

### General Improvements

- **Testing**: Add comprehensive testing for browser automation workflows (HIGH)
- **Documentation**: Add JSDoc comments and update code documentation (MEDIUM)
- **Monitoring**: Add logging and monitoring capabilities (LOW)
