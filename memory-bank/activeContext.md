# Active Context: NOTAM Parser for Israeli Aviation Authority
*Version: 1.0*
*Created: 2025-01-27*
*Last Updated: 2025-01-27*
*Current RIPER Mode: START*

## Current Focus
Project initialization and documentation of the existing NOTAM Parser codebase. The project is already well-developed with a complete TypeScript implementation, but requires proper documentation and memory bank setup for future development and maintenance.

## Recent Changes
- 2025-01-27 - Created memory-bank directory structure
- 2025-01-27 - Analyzed existing codebase and project structure
- 2025-01-27 - Created projectbrief.md with comprehensive project overview
- 2025-01-27 - Created techContext.md with technology stack documentation
- 2025-01-27 - Created systemPatterns.md with architecture documentation

## Active Decisions
- **Documentation Strategy**: COMPLETED - Comprehensive documentation of existing codebase
- **Memory Bank Structure**: COMPLETED - Established proper memory bank with all core files
- **Project Phase**: IN_PROGRESS - Currently in START phase, transitioning to DEVELOPMENT
- **Code Analysis**: COMPLETED - Thorough analysis of existing TypeScript implementation

## Next Steps
1. Complete START phase by creating progress.md
2. Update state.mdc to reflect completion of START phase
3. Transition to DEVELOPMENT phase
4. Enter RESEARCH mode to identify potential improvements
5. Document any identified enhancement opportunities

## Current Challenges
- **Project Maturity**: The project is already feature-complete, requiring identification of enhancement opportunities
- **Documentation Gap**: Existing code lacks comprehensive documentation for future maintenance
- **Testing Coverage**: No automated testing is currently implemented
- **Error Handling**: While present, error handling could be more comprehensive

## Implementation Progress
- [✓] Analyzed existing codebase structure
- [✓] Documented project requirements and scope
- [✓] Documented technology stack and dependencies
- [✓] Documented system architecture and design patterns
- [✓] Created memory bank directory structure
- [ ] Create progress.md with current project status
- [ ] Complete START phase transition
- [ ] Enter DEVELOPMENT phase

## Project Status Summary
The NOTAM Parser is a mature, feature-complete TypeScript application with:
- ✅ Complete CLI interface with comprehensive options
- ✅ Web scraping functionality for Israeli Aviation Authority data
- ✅ Advanced NOTAM parsing with date and coordinate extraction
- ✅ Multi-criteria filtering (date, airport, type)
- ✅ JSON export functionality
- ✅ Summary statistics generation
- ✅ Google Maps integration for coordinate data
- ✅ Robust error handling and validation

## Potential Enhancement Areas
- **Testing**: Add unit tests, integration tests, and E2E tests
- **Documentation**: Add JSDoc comments to all methods and classes
- **Error Handling**: Enhance error messages and recovery mechanisms
- **Performance**: Add caching for repeated requests
- **Features**: Add new filtering options or output formats
- **Monitoring**: Add logging and monitoring capabilities
