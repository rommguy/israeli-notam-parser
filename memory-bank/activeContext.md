# Active Context: NOTAM Parser for Israeli Aviation Authority

_Version: 1.2_
_Created: 2025-01-27_
_Last Updated: 2025-09-13_
_Current RIPER Mode: RESEARCH_

## Current Focus

Major UI enhancement completed with flexible date selection replacing the limited today/tomorrow options. Users can now select any date and view NOTAMs that are valid for that specific date. The system uses proper date-fns logic for accurate filtering and includes quick selection buttons for common dates. Complete system integration achieved with both CLI and web app working together seamlessly.

## Recent Changes

- **2025-09-13**: Updated NOTAM cards to display validity dates in UTC with clear UTC labels
- **2025-09-13**: Added date-fns-tz dependency for proper UTC timezone formatting
- **2025-09-13**: Replaced today/tomorrow selector with flexible date picker using Material-UI DatePicker
- **2025-09-13**: Enhanced date filtering logic using date-fns for accurate date comparisons
- **2025-09-13**: Added quick date selection buttons (Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow) for better UX
- **2025-09-13**: Updated all components and services to use Date objects instead of string literals
- **2025-09-13**: Updated web app to use single notams.json file with runtime filtering
- **2025-09-13**: Modified Vite build process to copy single NOTAM file instead of date-specific files
- **2025-09-13**: Updated notamService.ts to load single file and filter by date at runtime
- **2025-09-13**: Created GitHub Actions workflow for web deployment to GitHub Pages
- **2025-09-13**: Fixed GitHub Actions workflow to use simplified CLI commands
- **2025-09-13**: Updated daily-notam-fetch.yml to use `npm run parse` instead of outdated options
- **2025-09-13**: Fixed test suite by removing obsolete tests and fixing imports
- **2025-09-13**: All tests now passing (13 tests, 2 test suites)
- **2025-09-13**: Simplified CLI implementation to focus on core scraping functionality
- **2025-09-13**: Removed filtering options from CLI (filtering now handled by frontend)
- **2025-09-13**: Fixed CLI argument processing to properly route commands
- **2025-09-13**: Added proper browser lifecycle management in scrapeNotams function
- **2025-09-13**: Updated memory bank files to reflect current Playwright-based architecture
- **2025-09-13**: Removed outdated references to parser.ts and static scraping approach
- **Recent**: Major refactoring to replace Cheerio/Axios with Playwright browser automation
- **Recent**: Implemented dynamic NOTAM expansion with click automation and content waiting
- **Recent**: Added incremental fetching using hardcoded NOTAM ID comparison
- 2025-01-27 - Created memory-bank directory structure and completed START phase
- 2025-01-27 - Implemented complete React web application with Material-UI (web/ folder unchanged)

## Active Decisions

- **BROWSER AUTOMATION APPROACH**: Playwright chosen over static scraping for dynamic content handling
- **INCREMENTAL PROCESSING**: Hardcoded NOTAM ID comparison to avoid duplicate processing
- **FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING ENFORCED**: No custom classes allowed in this project - all business logic uses pure functions
- **CONSOLE OUTPUT CURRENT**: Storage persistence planned but not yet implemented
- **SIMPLIFIED CLI**: Advanced filtering and export functionality temporarily removed during refactoring
- **DUAL BROWSER MODES**: Support both headless and visible browser modes for debugging
- **Web Application Architecture**: COMPLETED - React with Material-UI, TypeScript, and Vite (unchanged)
- **Data Strategy**: CLI and web app are separate - web app uses static JSON files, CLI uses live browser automation

## Next Steps

1. **Optimize Incremental Updates**: Replace hardcoded NOTAM IDs with dynamic storage-based comparison
2. **Add Error Recovery**: Improve browser automation error handling and retry mechanisms
3. **Performance Optimization**: Add caching and optimize browser automation for repeated runs
4. **Testing Enhancement**: Add comprehensive testing for CLI argument processing and browser automation
5. **Documentation Updates**: Update README and other documentation to reflect simplified CLI
6. **Monitoring and Logging**: Add better logging and monitoring capabilities for production use

## Current Challenges

- **Hardcoded Dependencies**: NOTAM ID comparison uses hardcoded array instead of dynamic storage
- **Browser Automation Complexity**: Managing browser lifecycle and handling dynamic content failures
- **Performance Overhead**: Browser automation is slower and more resource-intensive than static scraping
- **Documentation Gap**: Code documentation needs updating for new simplified CLI architecture
