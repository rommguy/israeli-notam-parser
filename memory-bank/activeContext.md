# Active Context: NOTAM Parser for Israeli Aviation Authority
*Version: 1.0*
*Created: 2025-01-27*
*Last Updated: 2025-01-27*
*Current RIPER Mode: RESEARCH*

## Current Focus
Successfully completed implementation of a React web application for NOTAM viewing and management. The web application provides a modern, user-friendly interface for the existing NOTAM data with comprehensive filtering, read/unread tracking, and statistics dashboard.

## Recent Changes
- 2025-01-27 - Created memory-bank directory structure and completed START phase
- 2025-01-27 - Analyzed existing NOTAM Parser CLI codebase
- 2025-01-27 - Implemented complete React web application with Material-UI
- 2025-01-27 - Created 32-step implementation plan and executed all phases
- 2025-01-27 - Built responsive UI with date selection, ICAO filtering, and read/unread tracking
- 2025-01-27 - Integrated localStorage for persistent read state management
- 2025-01-27 - Added statistics dashboard and Google Maps integration
- 2025-01-27 - Updated project documentation and README files

## Active Decisions
- **Web Application Architecture**: COMPLETED - React with Material-UI, TypeScript, and Vite
- **State Management**: COMPLETED - React hooks with localStorage for persistence
- **UI Framework**: COMPLETED - Material-UI with aviation-themed colors and responsive design
- **Data Strategy**: COMPLETED - Static JSON file consumption with Vite build integration
- **Read/Unread Tracking**: COMPLETED - Global per-NOTAM ID with localStorage persistence

## Next Steps
1. Test web application with real user scenarios
2. Gather feedback on UI/UX design and functionality
3. Consider additional features like search, export, or advanced filtering
4. Monitor performance with larger NOTAM datasets
5. Evaluate integration with existing GitHub Actions workflow

## Current Challenges
- **Project Maturity**: The project is already feature-complete, requiring identification of enhancement opportunities
- **Documentation Gap**: Existing code lacks comprehensive documentation for future maintenance
- **Testing Coverage**: No automated testing is currently implemented
- **Error Handling**: While present, error handling could be more comprehensive

## Implementation Progress
- [✓] Analyzed existing codebase structure and requirements
- [✓] Completed comprehensive 32-step implementation plan
- [✓] Set up React application with Vite and Material-UI
- [✓] Implemented all core components (Layout, DateSelector, IcaoFilter, ViewToggle, NotamCard, NotamList, StatsBar)
- [✓] Built data layer with services and custom hooks
- [✓] Integrated localStorage for read/unread state persistence
- [✓] Added TypeScript type safety throughout application
- [✓] Configured build process with JSON data copying
- [✓] Created responsive design with aviation-themed UI
- [✓] Updated project documentation and README files
- [✓] Successfully built and tested application

## Project Status Summary
The NOTAM Parser is a mature, feature-complete TypeScript application with:
- ✅ Complete CLI interface with comprehensive options
- ✅ Web scraping functionality for Israeli Aviation Authority data
- ✅ Advanced NOTAM parsing with date and coordinate extraction
- ✅ Multi-criteria filtering (date, airport, type)
- ✅ JSON export functionality
- ✅ Summary statistics generation
- ✅ Google Maps integration for coordinate data
- ✅ Robust error handling and validation

## Potential Enhancement Areas
- **Testing**: Add unit tests, integration tests, and E2E tests
- **Documentation**: Add JSDoc comments to all methods and classes
- **Error Handling**: Enhance error messages and recovery mechanisms
- **Performance**: Add caching for repeated requests
- **Features**: Add new filtering options or output formats
- **Monitoring**: Add logging and monitoring capabilities
